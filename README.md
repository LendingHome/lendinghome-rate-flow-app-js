# LendingHome Rate Flow App

Base javascript app used in the lendinghome engineering "Rate Flow" interview exercise.


## Notes to candidates

* You should have been given some sort of guide before getting here, if not, reach out to us.
* Feel free to add or remove and library from this project, use the tools you prefer. Currently this is setup with React, feel free to use whatever else you want (or even vanilla js)


## Setup

This app depends on a build process and uses [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/). You'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) to run it.

Next you'll need a package manager like NPM or Yarn. NPM is distributed with Node so you should be good to go.


Run the following commands:

```
npm install
```

this will pull all the dependencies. Then to run the app, run:

```
npm start
```

That's it, navigate to the URL shown in you console. You can now edit files and see your changes reflected in the browser (this project has hot reload on by default)


## Tests

A very basic test harness is provided with no pre-existing test. Try to add a test.
